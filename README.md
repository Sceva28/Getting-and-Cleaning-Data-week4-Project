 Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-week4-Project

Repo for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" Week 4 project. Contains R code, codebook, and tidy data set for the Project.

Files:
CodeBook.md  has the description the how to use all of the variables, the data, and any  work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code for executing the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file. Here are the five steps:

Merging of  the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extraction of  only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

descriptive activity names have been used to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

From the data set in step 4, creates a second independent tidy data set with  average for every variable for each activity and each subject.
tidyData.txt is the output of the final step
